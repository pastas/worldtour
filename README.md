Map of Pastas models around the world


## Adding Pastas models
Adding Pastas models is simple. Create a GitHub issue to announce your addition, and add pas-files to the data/models folder. The metadata of the oseries should contain a latitude and longitude in degrees, and the metadata of the model (ml.model_info) should contain the name of the Author.
